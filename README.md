# suilend-public

This repository is a monorepo of projects meant to benefit from a workspace setup. This includes:

- sdk, a TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Suilend program published on npm as [`@suilend/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suilend/sdk).
- frontend, an open-source Suilend client powered by and developed alongside the Suilend SDK
- liquidator, a starting point for the Suilend community to build their own liquidator bots
